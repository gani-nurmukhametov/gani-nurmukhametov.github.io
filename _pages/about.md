Welcome! 
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu/).

<!-- I am an applied macroeconomist with interests primarily in the fields of applied macroeconomics, applied econometrics, forecasting, and growth. My passion is to develop theory-based policy implications through empirical work. My job market paper investigates the accuracy of IMF nowcasts in times of crises. This study provides guidance on how to further improve IMF nowcasts efficiency to better design and assess the loan programs, and ultimately help countries restore economic growth. The second paper in my dissertation empirically examines the role of macroprudential policy in addressing the effects of external shocks on financial stability. Prior to pursuing Ph.D., I served as a research assitant for two years at the University of Minnesota and University of Hawaii (Professor Inessa Love), primarily researching growth determinants in the emerging market economies --> 

I am on the job market during the 2022â€“2023 academic year and available for interviews.
